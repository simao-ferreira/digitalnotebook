# Project 25-20

On this project I attempt to learn the basics of Python according a process tailored to my personal schedule, this is an experience to make my learning process better and more efficient. 

The schedule takes two interesting points into consideration, matching more than one approach, in an agile way, where I try to explore and improve on my personal skills.

## Breakdown
The idea is to do cycles of 25 minutes, pomodoro style, until 20 hours of studding time are achieved. As a reference, if doing only a pomodoro a day, it will take around two months to complete the schedule. 

There are as well some time consuming tasks that should be accounted as necessary but not in the 25-20 schedule, like the time used to research the materials, time spent understanding how to evaluate the outcome of every lesson, what tools can be used to ensure focus, research into related but not directly meaningful questions raised during study times, time tracking structure, etc.

A necessary step to the proper success of this schedule is to answer the following questions:

* What is this skill?
* What is the intended use of this skill?
* How to break this skill into goals?
* What other skills are required to fully understand this skill?
* How to evaluate if goal was reached?
* How to make this process agile, ensuring the goal is still in reach?
* How much work/time is necessary outside of every lesson? Maybe describe some examples.

## Process
Lessons bullet points:

- Take your time to read, consider and question what you learn, critical thought is indispensable to improvement
- Exercise and apply what you learn, this will ensure better depth of knowledge (in or out of 25-20 schedule?)
- Write down notes and/or do bullet points, this will slow down the intake of material and help to maintain it
- Try to do the 25-20 lesson the last activity of your day.

## Note
Note to self, try to create bullet points with all stuff above adding the material used. Also extract parts to a different file to ensure clean and focus readme, same for research and materials.
