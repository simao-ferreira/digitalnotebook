# Project 25-20

On this project I attempt to learn the basics of Python according a process tailored to my personal schedule, this is an experience to make my learning process better and more efficient. 

The schedule takes two interesting processes, matching them together in one approach. I will try to do this in an agile way, so during the learning period it's expected that some changes happen. The goal for this task is to apply, test, explore and improve on my personal skill.

The idea is to do cycles of 25 minutes, pomodoro style, until 20 hours of studding time are achieved. 

As a reference, if doing only a pomodoro a day, it will take around two months to complete the schedule. 

## Breakdown
Apart from the 20 hours, there are some time consuming tasks that should be accounted as necessary, time used to research the materials, time spent understanding how to evaluate the outcome of the lessons, what tools can be used to ensure focus, research into related but not directly meaningful questions raised during study times, time tracking structure, etc.

A necessary step to the proper success of this schedule is to answer the following questions:

* What is this skill?
    - To get familiar with the python programming language
* What is the intended use of this skill?
    - Acquire enough knowledge to create applications or work on existent ones.  
* How to break this skill into goals?
    - All lessons should be prepared in advance. But I will instead create a lesson structure, where I will detail as much as I can prepare overall and update it as I proceed with the lessons, making it as agile as possible, to ensure that important themes that arise during the lessons have time to be added to the curriculum.
* What other skills are required to fully understand this skill?
    - Programming knowledge is expected and note taking (this needs work) 
* How to evaluate if goal was reached?
    - Considering the udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-complete/) I intend to use as base material, let's finish it to classify the effort as achieved. Further more successfully do all exercises on [hackinginscience](https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/)
* How to make this process agile, ensuring the goal is still in reach?
    - Maintain pomodoro discipline, 25 minutes cycles
    - Take copious notes, digital, paper, etc. 
    - Exercise in some way the given material
* How much work/time is necessary outside of every lesson? Maybe describe some examples.
    - Expect 1/2 pomodoros for [warm up](README.md#warm-up) and [cool down](README.md#cool-down)

## Process
Lessons bullet points:

- Take your time to read, consider and question what you learn, critical thought is indispensable to improvement
- Exercise and apply what you learn, this will ensure better depth of knowledge. Exercise in the 25-20 schedule if according to resources and also after.
- Write down notes and/or do bullet points, this will slow down the intake of material and help to maintain it
- Try to do the 25-20 lesson the last activity of your day.

## Warm-up
- Take a look at previous notes to situate yourself.

- Go through the expected lesson for the day, work out necessary extra efforts or preparations.

- If some questions was raised in the meantime answer it before starting the process.

## Cool-down
- Take relevant notes from what was learnt on the lesson, important points, questions, tangents.

- Answer tangents and questions if possible.

- Exercise the lesson learnt

## Materials
