# Asking for help

I was reading about `The Odin Project` and they have a paragraph about asking for help, considering my personal experience, asking for help has been one of the most stressful and painful experiences while growing as a developer, this is a personal view and it probably will vary for everyone.

The reason I find it stressful is mostly communication gaps, individuals in your team will have a different set of language and communication skills. 

This can have many reasons, conversation is in a second language, technical and programming jargon, different programming backgrounds, amongst many other reasons can add a layer of complexity to an ordinary question. 

One way to ease this gap and ensure communication is set at a bar minimum is to add context into questions, not only reviewing what you're asking but also making sure you know well what you are asking.

My rules of thumb are the following, first ask yourself the following question

    What is the problem your are trying to solve?

A second step is to use a rubber duck to explain as detailed as possible the issue, many times the answer is obvious just by explaining the issue out loud.

Another approach I take many times is to write it down on paper, to make sure the question makes sense and is understandable at a naked eye. Of course sometimes this will not be enough, if this is the case I tend to still listen with care, is not uncommon that by receiving the wrong replay I realise what I missed or wrongly understood.

This works better on a team where you know or understand the personalities around you, the better you know you teammates better the result. Some might be better at giving some technical advice, others on explaining the inner works of the code you are working on, some might be prone to monologue and deviate from the point at hand, others too busy to help and so give a hasty response.

When you don't know or have teammates the question still needs to be asked, so make sure you can explain it as best as you can, as detailed as you can.  

These are the questions `The Odin Project` suggests

    What do you think the problem is?
    What exactly do you want to happen?
    What is actually happening?
    How did you get there?
    What have you tried so far?
