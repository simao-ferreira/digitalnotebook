# Project 25-20

On this project I attempt to learn the basics of Python according a process tailored to my personal schedule, this is an experience to make my learning process better and more efficient. 

This schedule takes in account two processes, blending them in one approach. Using the pomodoro technique to have lessons in cycles of 25 minutes, until 20 hours of studding time are achieved. 

There are two goals for this task, one is to apply, test, explore and improve on my personal skill, the other is to get familiar and comfortable with the python language.

As a reference, if doing only a pomodoro a day, it will take around two months to complete the schedule. 
Apart from the 20 hours, there are some time consuming tasks that should be accounted as necessary, time to research materials, time preparing the lessons and minimizing distraction, time evaluating tools, researching related to but not in this project scope, time analyzing and tracking project's status and outcome's, etc.

## Breakdown
* What is the skill you want to learn?
    - To get familiar with the python programming language
* What is the intended use of this skill?
    - Acquire enough knowledge to create applications or work on existent ones.
* How to break this skill into goals?
    - I will be following a online course where some practical exercises appear from time to time, my goal here is to solve them without to much trouble. I will use my capability to solve them as evaluation for the first set of lessons.
* What other skills are required to fully understand this skill?
    - General programming knowledge is expected and note taking
* How to evaluate if goal was reached?
    - Considering the udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-complete/) I intend to use as base material, let's finish it to classify the effort as achieved. Further more successfully do all exercises on [hackinginscience](https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/)
* How to make this process agile, ensuring the goal is still in reach?
    - Maintain pomodoro discipline, 25 minutes cycles
    - Take copious notes, digital, paper, etc. 
    - Exercise in some way the given material
    - Evaluate lesson structure and effectiveness, adjust if necessary
* How much work/time is necessary outside of every lesson? 
    - Expect 1 to 2 pomodoros for [warm up](README.md#warm-up) and [cool down](README.md#cool-down)
