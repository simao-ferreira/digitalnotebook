# Notes

## Project 25-20 preparation
During preparation of these lessons I realized some of the sources will overlap and touch on subjects on a random order, makes sense since the medium and authors of all sources are different.
This means that is not strait forward as thought to use the good sources found.

Moving forward the source for the schedule should be the online course, remaining sources should be used as helpers or clarifiers for questions, doubts or tangent research.

## Expectations
For the first lessons the expectation is to go slow, get back as much as necessary and to create a set of notes, questions or tangents to clarify after. Material wise this will be 3 hours worth of information on types, structures and flow for python basics, most of it should already be known or intuited by my previous programming experience.

[W] Before the end of this cycle of 7 lessons start taking notes on what failed, what could be improved and how.

## First lesson

### Warm-up

Python as Java treat 'almost' everything as an object, both are well supported in several platforms (win, linux and macos) and both have very large and supportive communities. 
Both languages run on virtual machine through compiled bytecode.
