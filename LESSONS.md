# 48 Lessons

Here I will detail the lessons structure and material as much as I can prepare overall. This schedule will be updated as time proceeds, as agile as possible, to ensure that important questions that arise during the lessons have time to be added to the curriculum.

The minimus expected to achieve the goal is 48 lessons, more can be added if necessary.

## Lesson cycle
- Take your time to read, consider and question what you learn, critical thought is indispensable to improvement
- Exercise and apply what you learn, this will ensure better depth of knowledge. Exercise in the 25-20 schedule if according to resources and also after.
- Write down notes and/or do bullet points, this will slow down the intake of material and help to maintain it
- Try to do one 25-20 lesson the last activity of your day.

## Warm-up
- Take a look at previous notes to situate yourself.
- Go through the expected lesson for the day, work out necessary extra efforts or preparations.
- If some questions was raised in the meantime answer it before starting the process.

## Cool-down
- Take relevant notes from what was learnt on the lesson, important points, questions, tangents.
- Answer tangents and questions if possible.
- Exercise the lesson learnt
